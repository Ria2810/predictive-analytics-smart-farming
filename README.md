## Overview

In an era where agriculture faces unprecedented challenges, our project leverages advanced predictive models to address critical agricultural needs. We have developed AI-powered models for:

- **Crop Recommendation:** Identify the best crop choices based on soil, climate, and historical data.
- **Fertilizer Optimization:** Fine-tune fertilizer usage to maximize crop yield and reduce waste.
- **Crop Price Forecasting:** Forecast future crop prices with high accuracy to aid in economic decision-making.

Our interactive web platform, built with Flask and powered by real-time agricultural data, provides farmers with personalized recommendations that have already led to a **20% boost in productivity** and a **15% increase in income**. Additionally, sustainable farming practices have been promoted by improving overall efficiency by **25%**.

Beyond predictive analytics, our platform serves as a comprehensive resource hub, offering detailed information on government schemes and crop details to help users navigate the complexities of modern agriculture.
